# STANDOFF ‚Äì AI-Powered Hostage Negotiation Game

**STANDOFF** is an interactive narrative game in development that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), Speech-to-Text (STT), and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies to enable dynamic voice-based interactions with NPCs. The player assumes the role of a police negotiator in a live hostage scenario and must manage the crisis through dialogue, investigation, and press communication.

This organization serves as the **central hub** for the project, documenting its purpose, architecture, and related submodules and repositories.

## üìÅ Important Repositories

- ### [`Wiki`](https://github.com/beckukoppe/standoff/wiki)
  The current wiki of the project
  
- ### [`stt-llm-tts`](https://github.com/beckukoppe/stt-llm-tts)
  First Demo of stt to LLM and output with tts

- ### [`story-speaker-test`](https://github.com/beckukoppe/story-speaker-test/tree/main)
  Demo where a story is generated by a "story-llm", which creates a starting prompt for a smaller "speaker-llm"

## üß† Project Overview

### Core Concepts

- **LLM-Controlled NPCs**  
  NPCs (e.g. criminals, hostages, reporters) are driven by LLMs capable of producing realistic, adaptive dialogue.

- **Voice Interaction**  
  Players interact with NPCs using natural voice input (STT), while NPCs respond via generated speech (TTS), enabling fully voice-driven gameplay.

- **Narrative Control via AI**  
  The story evolves dynamically based on player dialogue, psychological state, and investigative progress.

- **Investigative Mechanics**  
  Players can access in-game systems (e.g. criminal records, hostage profiles) to gather intelligence and shape their negotiation strategy.

- **Media Influence & Stress Mechanics**  
  Your decicions impacts the public narrative and the negotiator‚Äôs internal stress, influencing available choices.
